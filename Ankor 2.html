      Doraemon (Japanese: ドラえもん) is a fictional title character in the
      Japanese manga and anime eponymous series of the same name created by
      Fujiko Fujio. Doraemon is a male robotic earless cat that travels back in
      time from the 22nd century to aid a preteen boy named Nobita Nobi. An
      official birth certificate for the character gives him a birth date of 3
      September 2112 and lists his city of residency as Kawasaki, Kanagawa, the
      city where the manga was created.[6] In 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry
      appointed Doraemon the country's "anime ambassador". Creation and
      conception Doraemon was originally conceived by Hiroshi Fujimoto following
      a series of three events. Firstly, when searching for ideas for a new
      manga, he wished that a machine existed that would come up with ideas for
      him. Secondly, he tripped over his daughter's toy. Thirdly, he heard cats
      fighting in his neighborhood.[7] The name, "Doraemon", can be translated
      roughly to "stray". Unusually, the name "Doraemon" (ドラえもん) is written
      in a mixture of two Japanese scripts: Katakana (ドラ) and Hiragana
      (えもん).

      Nobita Nobi (Japanese: 野比 のび太，Hepburn: Nobi Nobita) is a fictional
      character and one of the main characters in the Doraemon anime and manga
      series created by Fujiko Fujio, the pen name of writing team Hiroshi
      Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. He is also the main character in The Doraemons
      (special version). Known as Sidney, Specky and Noby in some English
      localizations of the anime, Nobita is usually depicted as an elementary
      school student. The title character, Doraemon, is sent back in time by
      Nobita's future descendants to look after Nobita. Along with Doraemon,
      Nobita is considered to be one of the most popular and widely recognizable
      manga characters due to the series' popularity, which extends beyond its

    <h1 id="p4">Tom and Jerry</h1>
    <p>
      Tom and Jerry is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy
      short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best
      known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the
      series centers on the enmity between the titular characters of a cat named
      Tom and a mouse named Jerry. Many shorts also feature several recurring
      characters. In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 Tom and
      Jerry shorts for MGM from 1940 to 1958.[1] During this time, they won
      seven Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film, tying for first place
      with Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies with the most awards in the category.
      After the MGM cartoon studio closed in 1957, MGM revived the series with
      Gene Deitch directing an additional 13 Tom and Jerry shorts for Rembrandt
      Films from 1961 to 1962. Tom and Jerry became the highest-grossing
      animated short film series of that time, overtaking Looney Tunes. Chuck
      Jones produced another 34 shorts with Sib Tower 12 Productions between
      1963 and 1967. Five more shorts have been produced since 2001, making a
      total of 166 shorts. A number of spin-offs have been made, including the
      television series The Tom and Jerry Show (1975), The Tom and Jerry Comedy
      Show (1980–1982), Tom & Jerry Kids (1990–1993), Tom and Jerry Tales
      (2006–2008), and The Tom and Jerry Show (2014–2021). In 1992, the first
      feature-length film based on the series, Tom and Jerry: The Movie, was
      released. 13 direct-to-video films have been produced since 2002. In 2021,
      a live-action/animated hybrid film was released. In 2019, a musical
      adaptation of the series, titled Tom and Jerry: Purr-Chance to Dream,
      debuted in Japan, in advance of Tom and Jerry's 80th anniversary.
