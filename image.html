      Doraemon (Japanese: ドラえもん) is a fictional title character in the
      Japanese manga and anime eponymous series of the same name created by
      Fujiko Fujio. Doraemon is a male robotic earless cat that travels back in
      time from the 22nd century to aid a preteen boy named Nobita Nobi. An
      official birth certificate for the character gives him a birth date of 3
      September 2112 and lists his city of residency as Kawasaki, Kanagawa, the
      city where the manga was created.[6] In 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry
      appointed Doraemon the country's "anime ambassador". Creation and
      conception Doraemon was originally conceived by Hiroshi Fujimoto following
      a series of three events. Firstly, when searching for ideas for a new
      manga, he wished that a machine existed that would come up with ideas for
      him. Secondly, he tripped over his daughter's toy. Thirdly, he heard cats
      fighting in his neighborhood.[7] The name, "Doraemon", can be translated
      roughly to "stray". Unusually, the name "Doraemon" (ドラえもん) is written
      in a mixture of two Japanese scripts: Katakana (ドラ) and Hiragana
      (えもん).

      character and one of the main characters in the Doraemon anime and manga
      series created by Fujiko Fujio, the pen name of writing team Hiroshi
      Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. He is also the main character in The Doraemons
      (special version). Known as Sidney, Specky and Noby in some English
      localizations of the anime, Nobita is usually depicted as an elementary
      school student. The title character, Doraemon, is sent back in time by
      Nobita's future descendants to look after Nobita. Along with Doraemon,
      Nobita is considered to be one of the most popular and widely recognizable
      manga characters due to the series' popularity, which extends beyond its
      native Japan.
